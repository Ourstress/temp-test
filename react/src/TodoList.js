import React, { Component } from "react";

class TodoList extends Component {
  render() {
    return <header>hello</header>;
  }
}

export default TodoList;

// Your task is to rename the header of TodoList component from Hello to Todolist
// Additional notes:
// TodoList is a React component
// React components tell the browser what to put up on screen
// In our example above, TodoList component tells the browser to put up a Header element on screen
// We can use different React components. In this case, TodoList is a class component, more on that later.
